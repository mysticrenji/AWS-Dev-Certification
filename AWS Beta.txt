Just from exam. Here is me thoughts:

Overall - it is MUCH MORE complicated exam then Solutions Architect Associate I took last year, where I got 97% score and still wondering what I have missed.

Only a 10-15 questions out of 70 were as simple as I had on SAA Exam.

I did't take Developer exam before so don't know how complicated it is, but for current BETA you have to study much harder than for SAA exam.

It is 150 minutes and 70 questions total. When I get to the very last question I had about 70 minutes left and 22 questions flagged for review. For all of this 22 questions I was not sure what the correct answer is. I spend all remaining time reviewing my answers (all answers, and found some mistakes in non-flagged questions as well).

Here is my list of AWS services FAQs I would recommend to read:

KMS - I was really surprised by the number of questions about KMS encryption, KMS SDK and encryption at all.

API Gateway - And you need to know if a great details.

Lambda - And also Step functions.

CloudFormation - And you should know it in a good details.

DynamoDB - Read/write capacity calculations, Scans, performance, LSI/GSI.
